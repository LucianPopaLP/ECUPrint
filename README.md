# ECUPrint Dataset

The ECUPrint dataset is a collection of raw CAN voltage samples measured with the PicoScope with a sample interval of 2 nanoseconds (sample rate was set to 500 MS/s) and CAN logs with frames collected with a Vector CANCaseXL device.

## Data Organization

There are raw voltage data files for 54 ECUs and 433 IDs from 10 different vehicles, one of them being a heavy-duty vehicle that is compliant to the SAE J1939 standard. They are structured per-vehicle and per-ECU as they were identified in our work.
